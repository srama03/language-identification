## Language Identification using FastText
### Introduction
Language identification is a foundational task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) with applications in translation, sentiment analysis, and more. This project leverages Facebook's FastText library to create a language identification model capable of detecting eight languages, including Esperanto. By utilizing n-grams and word embeddings, the model can handle obscure words and diverse dialects effectively.

### Objective
To build a robust language identification system that:

* Detects text in eight languages with high accuracy.
* Handles obscure words and dialect variations using n-grams.
  
### Key Features
* Trained a FastText-based model for language classification.
* Utilized word embeddings and n-grams to ensure robustness.
* Tested model performance on diverse datasets.
  
### Tech Stack
* Python
* FastText
